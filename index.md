# Dans Labs

The
[Research and Innovation department](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/research-and-innovation?set_language=en)
of
[DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/nl)
is focused on supporting and innovating the DANS services.
Our objective throughout all our activities
is to make digital information available in a sustainable form
during the different phases of the research cycle.

We collaborate on several research projects with other parties and deliver the outcomes usually as *labs*.

# The labs

When we engage in research, there are often results in the form of a proof-of-concept, a pilot,
a demonstrator, or something else that is expressed in software.

The quality and quantity of the individual labs vary wildly, which of course has to do
with the amount of resources that has been spent on them, and on whether the lab became the
basis for further work.

This place is where we collect all those labs.
**Click on the name** to see a short description of a lab.
Every lab is a github repository. Go to the lab itself
**by clicking on its icon** in order to find the maximum
information available.
