# About
Assessment tool for the European DARIAH infrastructure.
It is a website where *contributions* to DARIAH by the member states
can be entered, assessed, and reviewed.

# Tech
The technology used is a minimalistic Python backend (`bottle`),
which powers a heavy client application, written in modern Javascript (`es6`),
using `React` as a framework.

# Docs
The work is extensively documented. 
A lot of new web technology is introduced, explained, implemented, and tweaked.

Here is the [site](https://dariah-beta.dans.knaw.nl), which contains links to all documentation.
