# About
Assessment tool for the European DARIAH infrastructure.
It is a website where *contributions* to DARIAH by the member states
can be entered, assessed, and reviewed.

# Tech
The technology used is a minimalistic Python backend (`bottle`),
which powers a heavy client application, written in modern Javascript (`es6`),
using `React` as a framework.

# Docs
The work is extensively documented. 
A lot of new web technology is introduced, explained, implemented, and tweaked.

The
[repo](https://github.com/Dans-labs/dariah)
contains all code and documentation.
