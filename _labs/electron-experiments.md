# About
Experiments in building frontend applications using JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, [Electron], [ReactJS] and [Redux]. This project is part of an investigation in user interface frameworks/libraries to be used for two new frontend modules in [EASY].

# Tech
Electron facilitates building native applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is also possible to employ React in Electron apps. Besides that, TypeScript provides typechecking at compile time, which avoids encountering a lot of errors on runtime.

# Content
Within the repository there are a number of subprojects:

* [SysInfoApp] - a basic Electron application that displays some system specific information.
* [shoppinglist-electron] - a shoppinglist application build using Electron and plain JavaScript
* [shoppinglist-electron-react] - a shoppinglist application build using Electron and React
* [shoppinglist-electron-react-typescript] - a shoppinglist application build using Electron, React and TypeScript
* [shoppinglist-react-typescript] - a web-based shoppinglist application using React and TypeScript
* [searchapp-react] - a small search engine with live result updating using React in the browser
* [redux-tutorial] - a first look at Redux, following a [tutorial] by [LearnCode.academy]
* [redux-tutorial-typescript] - a port from above tutorial in TypeScript, plus a deep dive into [Webpack] configuration
* [redux-form-tutorial] - experiments with the various form configurations from [redux-form], and a first look at routing to different pages using [react-router]
