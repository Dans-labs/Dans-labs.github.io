# About
Experiments in building frontend applications using [JavaFX] and [RxJava]. This project is part of an investigation in user interface frameworks/libraries to be used for two new frontend modules in [EASY].

# Tech
JavaFX facilitates building native desktop applications using Java, Scala or other JVM languages. RxJava is used to coordinate between user input events and the backend system.

# Content
Within the repository there are a number of subprojects:

* [shoppinglist] - a shoppinglist application build using JavaFX and RxJava, in Scala
* [shoppinglist-scalafx] - a shoppinglist application build using ScalaFX (a port of JavaFX in Scala) and RxJava
* [mvi-lib] - a library to support building JavaFX applications using the [MVI pattern] by Hannes Dorfmann
* [bmi-calculator] - a simple BMI calculator build using JavaFX, RxJava and the MVI pattern
* [shoppinglist-mvi] - a shoppinglist application build using JavaFX, RxJava and the MVI pattern
